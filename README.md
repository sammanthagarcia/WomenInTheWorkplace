## Project Description
Women, especially Women of Color, experience discrimination in education and in the workplace. This project is using datasets provided by Current Population Survey (CPS) in 2019 to compare the difference in annual income, occupation, and educational level between White Women and Women of Color (Black, Asian, Hispanic). Provided by the CPS, this project will also use an article from 2000 that reported Women of different races' occupation and annual income. 

The goal is to visualize how Women of Color are lower on the social hierarchy simply because of their gender and race. This project will spread awareness on the systemic issues Women face everyday and how Women of Color are still at a severe disadvantage, even after several efforts to change the patriarchy. The results of this project will help pose different ways Women of Color can overcome gender and racial discrimination. 

## Hypothesis
Because gender and racial discrimination are still prevalent today, I expect my results to show that there are more White Women in management positions and with a higher degree of education. On the other hand, the total amount of Women of Color at each educational level will be consistently lower than White Women. 

## Methods and Tools for Analysis
After retrieving the datasets from the Census Population Survey (census.gov), I saved them as .csv files in Google Sheets. Then, I imported them into Jupyter Notebook for data cleanup and for generating visualizations. 

In my Jupyter Notebook, I used the following Python libraries to create my visualizations: 
 1) matplotlib: This library was used for creating the horizontal bar charts for each table. 
 2) numpy: I used numpy for simple functions, such as finding the length of a list or using a specific range of numbers. 
 3) pandas: This was used to import and read the .csv files, subsequently storing them into a Data Frame.

Using horizontal bar charts for my visualizations allowed me to see how there are less Women of Color in education and in the workforce. It also showed that there were more Women of Color with service occupations and White Women in management/professional occupations.
